# Introduction

Mastodon requires a server (physical or virtual), and it’s also highly recommended to use an S3 bucket to store all local/remote media.

Any cloud provider should be fine. Try to find something local to your region. I’m in Sydney, so I’m using Linode, and Wasabi because they have Sydney based data centers, and offer good prices.

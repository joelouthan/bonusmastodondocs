# Cloud Media Storage (S3 Buckets)

There are plenty of cloud storage providers that support the AWS S3 bucket hosting.&#x20;

AWS S3 has 99.999% SLA, but also very very expensive. Don’t use it.

* [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* [Digital Ocean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces)
* [Linode Object Storage](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/)
* [Vultr Object Storage](https://www.vultr.com/products/object-storage/)
* [Exoscale Simple Object Storage (SOS)](https://www.exoscale.com/object-storage/)
* [OVH Object Storage](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/public-cloud/object-storage/)
* [Wasabi Cloud Storage](https://wasabi.com/s3-compatible-cloud-storage/)&#x20;
* [Backblaze Cloud Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html)
* [Jortage Communal Cloud](https://jortage.com/) (huge fan of this service for US instances)
* Bunny.net Cloud Storage (coming 2023)

## Recommendations

I'm using Wasabi, because they are very cheap. They have a history of outages in their primary regions, but in Sydney, I haven't experienced anything.

Just try to find one in your region… not a lot “tuning” that can be done on this front.
